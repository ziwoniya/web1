<p>Julie explained: “There wasn’t a lot of options open for women like Jean, apart from being clerical or librarians.
“One of the opportunities they could have, if they weren’t married, was to work in the Foreign Office.”
The star went on to share how “frustrated” she felt in that scene, even saying she let the role nearly get the better of her.</p>
<p>“Everything is against her - her age, her experience is not valued,” she continued. “And it was incredibly frustrating reading that scene, because you want to jump over the desk and grab the young whipper snapper by the neck and ping his braces.
“In that one scene, it encapsulated everything about the frustration that women had, after being so useful and then just thrown on the scrap heap.</p>
